UCB Data Analytics-Challenge 4 

CHALLENGE PURPOSE : In this challenge, will demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

The dataset(s) used: 
Source: PyCitySchools , Resource folder
Dataset: Two Excel files schools_complete and students_complete, Data files are in a CSV format. 
         The dataset is referanced and leveraged directly in my PyCitySchools_starter.ipyn notebook
         The REPO inlcudes the above and all required resultsing dataframes. 
  # Summary and Conclusions
## Summary of Analysis:

 - Charter Schools Outperform District Schools: Charter schools consistently outperform district schools across all metrics, suggesting the charter school model is more effective.
 - Smaller Schools Perform Better: Smaller schools tend to outperform larger schools, indicating potential benefits of smaller learning environments.
 -Spending is Not a Strong Indicator: There is no clear correlation between per student spending and school performance, suggesting factors beyond funding are more influential.
 -School Type is a Strong Predictor: School type (charter vs. district) is a strong predictor of student achievement, with charter schools consistently outperforming district schools.

## Conclusions:

- School Type is a Critical Factor: The type of school (charter or district) has a more significant impact on student performance than factors like school size, spending, or student demographics. This suggests that the charter school model, with its unique governance, accountability, and operational structures, is a key driver of student success.
 - Smaller Schools Offer Potential Advantages: Smaller schools, especially those with fewer than 1,000 students, tend to outperform larger schools. This suggests that smaller learning environments may provide more individualized attention and support, leading to improved student outcomes.
